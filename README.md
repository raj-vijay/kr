# Knowledge Representation

The Machine Learning Library hosts my code base for the various exercises and the real world problems pertaining to Knowledge Representation, that I have solved and completed as part of my work on Artificial Intelligence.

Knowledge Representation is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the representation of domain specific knowledge in a form that can be utilised by computer systems. Importantly, this in the domain of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with thinking, and how thinking can contribute to intelligent behavior.


## Repositories

The repository for Knowledge Representation is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to real-world knowledge representation problems. 

It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file, and it is always possible go back to previous versions of we make any mistakes.

So again, feel free, be more human, to make mistakes and to learn from them.
